# Buddy Food — Driver-First Order Flow: Remediation Phases

Living tracker for fixing the gaps found in the three-flow audit. Each phase is
independently shippable and must end with a green build + its manual test
checklist before the next phase starts.

**Locked design decisions**
- **Flow 3 → full dual-leg rebuild** (real two-driver delivery: `legs[]`, item/stop split, second OTP, two-marker tracking). Phase 1 ships an interim safety layer first; Phase 6 is the real rebuild.
- **Restaurant rejection → immediate drop + refund.** Remove the misleading 3-strike messaging and the unused resend endpoint (Phase 3).
- **Start with Phase 1 now.**

## Phase 1 — Stop the bleeding (money & stuck-orders) · S ✅
Interim safety for the current earnings-share model, before the Phase 6 rebuild.

- ✅ **F-3B** Atomic shared-driver join — `acceptSharedOrderDelivery` now uses a conditional `findOneAndUpdate` on `dispatch.sharedPartnerId:null` (+ `deliveryPartnerId != joiner`); distinguishes already-taken / self / idempotent-retry. `order.service.js`.
- ✅ **F-3A** Share-timeout solo-complete — added `dispatch.shareOpenedAt` (schema) + `SHARE_TIMEOUT_MS` (helpers, 5 min); set on both auto-share (accept) and manual `shareOrderDelivery`; `completeDelivery` lets the primary finish solo with the full earning restored + admin alert once the window elapses.
- ✅ **F-3C** Admin reassign no longer silently drops the shared partner — captures/​notifies the dropped shared partner and re-opens the share slot (restarting the timeout clock) for bulk orders. `assignDeliveryPartnerAdmin`.
- ✅ Settlement double-fire: confirmed blocked by `isStatusAdvance(from,'delivered')` re-entry guard (can't re-deliver → can't re-settle).

*Files:* `order.model.js`, `order.helpers.js`, `order-delivery.service.js`, `order.service.js`.
*Test:* place a ≥20-item order, accept as driver, let share timeout elapse → primary can complete; two drivers race the shared slot → exactly one joins; admin reassigns primary on a shared order → shared partner notified, order not stuck.

## Phase 2 — Driver-first operational holes · S–M ✅
- ✅ **F-1A** Restaurant no-response escalation in `recoverStuckOrders`: Tier 1 (> `RESTAURANT_ACK_RESEND_MS`, 2m) re-notifies restaurant(s) + admin once (throttled by `dispatch.restaurantAckResendAt`); Tier 2 (> `RESTAURANT_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS`, 5m) auto-rejects → refund → releases the driver.
- ✅ **F-1B** Server-side geofence `assertRiderAtTarget` on reached-pickup (restaurant/active-pickup) and reached-drop (customer). Fail-OPEN on missing/stale (>10m) rider location; `*_GEOFENCE_METERS` = 1000m, tunable.
- ✅ **F-1C** Pickup ready-state guard: single-restaurant pickup requires `orderStatus === 'ready_for_pickup'`; multi requires the current pickup `status === 'ready'` — closes the `isStatusAdvance` gap that let `confirmed→picked_up` slip through.
- ✅ **F-3D** `shareOrderDelivery` now re-checks `isShareRequired` server-side (item count ≥ threshold), closing the UI-only abuse gate.

*Note:* Tier-2 auto-cancel for a multi-restaurant no-response only pushes the cancellation to the primary restaurant (others never engaged); refine in Phase 3 if needed.

## Phase 3 — Flow 2 reject/resend correctness · S–M ✅
- ✅ **F-2A** Reject policy is now consistently **immediate-drop**. Removed the dead 3-strike system end-to-end: `resendOrderToRestaurant` service + controller + route deleted; `MAX_PICKUP_RESEND_ATTEMPTS` + `canResendPickup` + `shouldPermanentlyDropPickup` + `getPickupRejectionAttempts` removed from policy; vestigial `pickup.rejectionAttempts` increment dropped; all "after 3 attempts / resend up to 3 times" copy replaced with immediate-drop messaging; orphaned frontend `RejectedOrderModal.jsx` + `deliveryAPI.resendOrderToRestaurant` deleted. Updated the `failureReason` classifier to key off the new note text.
- ✅ **Post-pickup rejection flow** — a restaurant can no longer reject once its items are picked up or the order has left the pickup phase (`picked_up`/`reached_drop`/`delivered`). When dropping the last un-picked restaurant leaves everything else already picked up, the order auto-advances to the delivery phase instead of stranding the driver.

*Kept:* `resendDeliveryNotificationRestaurant` (restaurant-initiated **driver** re-search) — unrelated, still live.

## Phase 4 — State-machine & real-time integrity · M ✅ (backend; client dedup deferred → 4b)
- ✅ **4A** Explicit `ORDER_STATUS_TRANSITIONS` adjacency map + `canOrderTransition`/`assertOrderTransition` in policy (canonical state machine). Wired into `completeDelivery`: `delivered` may only follow `picked_up` — closes the rank-only hole where `ready_for_pickup → delivered` (skipping pickup) was accepted because 80 > 40.
- ✅ **Durable event outbox** — new `FoodOrderEvent` model (`food_order_events`) + `order.eventSeq` counter. `enqueueOrderEvent` (the single milestone chokepoint, 19 call sites) now atomically allocates a per-order `seq`, generates a unique `eventId`, appends to the outbox, and passes seq/eventId into the BullMQ job.
- ✅ **Seq-aware, multi-driver `/sync`** — `resyncState` now matches primary **OR** shared partner (shared driver can finally recover), accepts `sinceSeq`, and returns `lastEventSeq` + the missed-event tail; socket `resync` forwards `sinceSeq` and emits `{ lastEventSeq, missedEvents }` in `resync_complete`.

*Deferred to Phase 4b:* threading `seq`/`eventId` onto every live socket payload + client-side dedup across the 3 frontends. The outbox + seq-aware `/sync` already give clients a reliable gap-detection/replay path on reconnect; live-payload dedup is an optimization, not a correctness gap.

## Phase 5 — Flow 2 orchestration · M ✅ (backend + driver stop-selection; list UI deferred → 5b)
- ✅ **Combined ETA** — menu items already carried `preparationTime` (threaded through `order-pricing.service.js`) but it was never persisted and `estimatedTime` was hardcoded `30`. Now each pickup stores `prepMinutes` (its slowest item) and the order ETA = slowest kitchen (they cook in parallel) + travel time over the trip distance. Helpers: `parsePrepMinutes`, `computeRestaurantPrepMinutes`, `computeCombinedPrepMinutes`, `computeOrderEtaMinutes`.
- ✅ **Pickup sequencing** — new `pickups[].sequence`, assigned at create by `assignPickupSequence` (farthest-from-customer first, nearest last, so the final leg is shortest — deterministic, no routing API call). `getNextPickup` follows `sequence` but diverts to any already-ready stop so the driver never idles at a cold kitchen. Wired into reached-pickup (geofence target) and confirm-pickup. Driver app's `useProximityCheck` mirrors the same rule.
- ✅ **Waiting state + progress** — `pickups[].readyAt` recorded when a kitchen marks ready; `deliveryState.status = 'waiting_for_food'` when the driver arrives early; `getPickupProgress` ("Picked up 1 of 2") added to `emitOrderUpdate`, the restaurant broadcast, and the reached/pickup events. New `pickup_leg_completed` milestone so intermediate legs land in the outbox (previously silent).

*Deferred to Phase 5b:* the full multi-stop **list** UI in the driver app (ordered stop cards, per-stop ETA/waiting badges). The data contract (`sequence`, `prepMinutes`, `readyAt`, `pickupProgress`) is now served, and stop-selection already follows it.

## Phase 6 — Flow 3 true dual-leg (the big one) · L
- ⬜ Data model: per-driver `legs[]` (assigned/arrived/picked/delivering/delivered), item→driver split map, second OTP.
- ⬜ Per-leg endpoints + "parent DELIVERED only when both legs done" guard.
- ⬜ Item/stop split (stop-level for multi-restaurant, item-level within one restaurant).
- ⬜ Customer two-driver tracking (two markers / two rows).
- ⬜ Admin force-assign second driver.
- ⬜ Restaurant labeled handover (pack two sets, hand correct bag).

## Phase 7 — Cleanup & hardening · M
- ⬜ Dedicated FCM ring channel / full-screen intent for driver offers.
- ⬜ Remove dead COD code paths (or formally gate them).
- ⬜ Consolidate the parallel QC (`quick_orders`) legacy path.
